## Initializing the Repository

After successfully cloning the repository into your local development environment, a source code package must be built based on your language of choice. This will define which language the CDK code will be written in.

Run the `initialize-repo.sh` script at the root level of the project file. This script will prompt a series of questions before initializing a git repo using the current directory name as the solution name. It will also stage the `deployment` and `source` directories with fundamental assets for your solution.

- The language selected when running this script will determine whether to provision a TypeScript, Python, Java, or C# CDK project into your `deployment` and `source` directories. This is the language you will be working with when defining your infrastructure using the CDK. Your source code packages for Lambda functions and custom resources may be in different languages.
