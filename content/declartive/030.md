## Building your CDK Project

After initializing the repository, make any desired code changes. As you work through the development process, the following commands might be useful for 
periodic testing and/or formal testing once development is completed. These commands are CDK-related and should be run at the /source level of your project.

CDK commands:
- `cdk init` - creates a new, empty CDK project that can be used with your AWS account.
- `cdk synth` - synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template generated from your CDK project to the CLI.
- `cdk deploy` - deploys your CDK project into your AWS account. Useful for validating a full build run as well as performing functional/integration testing
of the solution architecture.

Additional scripts related to building, testing, and cleaning-up assets may be found in the package.json file or in similar locations for your selected CDK language. You can also run `cdk -h` in the terminal for details on additional commands.
