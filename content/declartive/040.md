## Running Unit Tests

The `/source/run-all-tests.sh` script is the centralized script for running all unit, integration, and snapshot tests for both the CDK project as well as any associated Lambda functions or other source code packages. 

- Note: It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that all test commands are called in this script, and that it is kept up to date.

This script is called from the solution build scripts to ensure that specified tests are passing while performing build, validation and publishing tasks via the pipeline.
