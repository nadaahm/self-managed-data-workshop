## File Structure

Upon successfully cloning the repository into your local development environment but **prior** to running the initialization script, you will see the following file structure in your editor:

```
|- .github/ ...               - resources for open-source contributions.
|- deployment/                - contains build scripts, deployment templates, and dist folders for staging assets.
  |- .typescript/                - typescript-specific deployment assets.
  |- .python/                   - python-specific deployment assets.
  |- .java/                     - java-specific deployment assets.
  |- .csharp/                   - csharp-specific deployment assets.
|- source/                    - all source code, scripts, tests, etc.
  |- .typescript/                - typescript-specific source assets.
  |- .python/                   - python-specific source assets.
  |- .java/                     - java-specific source assets.
  |- .csharp/                   - csharp-specific source assets.
|- .gitignore
|- .viperlightignore          - Viperlight scan ignore configuration  (accepts file, path, or line item).
|- .viperlightrc              - Viperlight scan configuration.
|- buildspec.yml              - main build specification for CodeBuild to perform builds and execute unit tests.
|- CHANGELOG.md               - required for every solution to include changes based on version to auto-build release notes.
|- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md         - standardized open source file for all solutions.
|- CONTRIBUTING.md            - standardized open source file for all solutions.
|- copy-repo.sh               - copies the baseline repo to another directory and optionally initializes it there.
|- initialize-repo.sh         - initializes the repo.
|- LICENSE.txt                - required open source file for all solutions - should contain the Apache 2.0 license.
|- NOTICE.txt                 - required open source file for all solutions - should contain references to all 3rd party libraries.
|- README.md                  - required file for all solutions.

* Note: Not all languages are supported at this time. Actual appearance may vary depending on release.
```

**After** running the initialization script, you will see a language-specific directory in both the `/source` and `/deployment` folders expanded based on your CDK language choice. Example below after `./initialize-repo.sh` is run with `typescript` selected as the language of choice. Notice the removal of the language-specific directories after running the command. The repo is now ready for solution development.

```

  |- cdk-solution-helper/     - helper function for converting CDK output to a format compatible with the AWS Solutions pipelines.
  |- build-open-source-dist.sh  - builds the open source package with cleaned assets and builds a .zip file in the /open-source folder for distribution to GitHub
  |- build-s3-dist.sh         - builds the solution and copies artifacts to the appropriate /global-s3-assets or /regional-s3-assets folders.
  |- clean-dists.sh           - utility script for clearing distributables.
|- source/                    - all source code, scripts, tests, etc.
